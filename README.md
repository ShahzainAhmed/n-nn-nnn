# The program takes a number n and computes n+nn+nnn

## Problem Description:
### The program takes a number n and computes n+nn+nnn.

## Problem Solution: 
- Take the value of a element and store in a variable n.
- Convert the integer into string and store it in another variable.
- Add the string twice so the string gets concatenated and store it in another variable.
- Then add the string thrice and assign the value to the third variable.
- Add the values in all the integers.
- Print the total value of the expression.
- Done.

## Program Explanation:
- User must first enter the value and store it in a variable n.
- The integer is converted to string for concatenation of the value of n.
- The string is then concatenated once and twice and stored in separate variables.
- Later to find the total sum, the string is converted back to integer.
